<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

By analyzing keylogger data, we can detect how productive a user is at any given time. Based on this data we can suggest breaks to the user, which will help them to stay productive troughout the day. 

Additionaly we can detect how much time any appliocation is used and therefore simplify the task of time tracking.

In order to protect the users privacy, all the keylogger data is stored locally on the users device and is only used to extract metrics about the users state of productivity. The only data that is sent to servers is the resulting metrics.

### Built With
BreakWise can be split in two parts: The Software on the users working device and the webapp, which is used to display the metrics. 

#### Backend
[![Python3][python.org]][python-url]

The logging software is written in python3 using [pynput](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)

#### Frontend
[![React][React.js]][React-url]
[![Framework 7][framework7.io]][Framework-Url]
[![Vite][vitejs.dev]][vite-url]
[![Firebase][firebase.google.com]][firebase-url]

The webapp is written in [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) using [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The data is stored in a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) database.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
